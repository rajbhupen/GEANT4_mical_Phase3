# mical+cmvd(Tiles Format): With Kohlahal trackfit algorithm.
# mical: has 11 iron 11 RPC. Top 10th RPC is dummy only used in trackfitalg in presence of magfield (Note: this is changed see below)
# bottom is iron then rpc


#24 June 2022: added cosmic flux root file(flux_Pethu_FLUKA_SIBYLL.root) in gen4 in primary generator action.

# June 2022: ijk was 1 in eventaction. so left wall was 4500 and top was 4600mm.
cal0sdmessenger corrected.
Tiles geometry added: 8tileno+nintile
det area fixed position <e-10 added in mevent action

# last iteration added in trackfit alg. to do extrapolation only if reconstruction is there.

#25 June 2022: Extra walls shifted more back since few events with 1 &2 hits present.

# 26 June 2022: Extrapolation to roof added.

# not using random no. in MultipleScattering function in InoTrackfitAlg.cc

//11/07/22

# Changed Stack posin room
# Added frpshift in shiftinZ

# Removed Dummy layer RPC..
- For this nlayer is then 10, iron layer is 11..
- doubleLa in include/InoTrackFitAlg.h is 10, But ZPosLayer is 12, 11 for cmvd(Dummy) 12 for roof
SO for extrapolation for cmvd added ZposLayer[10] by hand and kept diffplane==1 and totdist accordingly. Now extrapolation for cmvd will take place in one step as like roof.


18 july 2022
step size is 1mm in iron rest according to widths. InitTrack corrected. 
Field Derivative is set 0 by hand.

minclosedist<300 in EventAction.cc commented off

# After meeting with Sir Monday 11 july 2022:
scale magnetic field hist by 0.85(it was missing in my files).
Also added InitTrack function in InotrackFitalg() before calling Get Propagator.

# things to be done:
Change Gen4:
reduce cmvd branches
